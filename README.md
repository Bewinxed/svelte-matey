** THIS IS STILL ALPHA **

Welcome to "svelte-matey", a VS Code extension that provides a tree view of your Svelte routes, making it easier to navigate and manage your Svelte applications.

**I Recommend you add this to your settings.json to make labels easier to read!**

    "workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short"
}
```
